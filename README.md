# todolist

This project was a part of a hackathon conducted by Computer Society of India (CSI) named CodeChanakya in which I played the role of team leader for my two team members. We secured 3rd prize in the same.

### What is ToDoList?
A to-do list is a simple list of tasks that allows you to visually see what you need to accomplish. It’s all in one place for easy reference! Grows and shortens as you work through items posted in a common place so you don’t forget your tasks and is an organizational scheduling tool.

### Why use it?
Remind yourself of what’s important and what needs to get done It can be fun! Playing with the list can help you think outside of the box for solutions

### How to use?
Focus on why each task is important to you. Think about what rewards you expect after completing each task. List when each task needs to be completed. Cross off items and celebrate their completion.
